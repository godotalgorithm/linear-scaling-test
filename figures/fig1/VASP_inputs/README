We had to internally change the maximum number of k-points allowed in VASP to run this calculation.
A 2x2x2 supercell w/ 150x150x150 k-grid was used instead of a 300x300x300 k-grid on the primitive cell
because VASP has a bottleneck when constructing and reducing extremely large k-grids.

We do not copy the POTCAR file here because it is a propriety part of the VASP software.
We use the standard Cu LDA POTCAR file found in VASP version 5.4.4,
which was generated in 2005 and thus common to many other versions of VASP.
