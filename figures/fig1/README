A.

DFT (VASP 5.4.4) and tight-binding DOS were both generated on a 300x300x300 k-point grid at T = 0.03 eV

DFT calculation used the standard copper PAW (3p in core) with LDA and a standard 300 eV basis cutoff

For referencing, the Fermi energy is 2.974605 eV in the tight-binding DOS and 8.4055 eV in VASP

B.

For both DFT & tight-binding:
T = 0.1 eV used a 80x80x80 k-point grid
T = 0.2 eV used a 40x40x40 k-point grid
T >= 0.3 eV used a 20x20x20 k-point grid

We report the DFT internal energy as reported by VASP, which is the cohesive energy relative to an isolated, spin-unpolarized copper atom

C.

These values are plotted from near the equilibrium Cu-Cu spacing, ~2.5 A, to near the cutoff, ~6.6 A

D.

k-grids used to converge this plot:

T = 0.03 -> 300^3
T = 0.1  -> 150^3
T = 0.3  -> 80^3
T = 1.0  -> 40^3
T = 3.0  -> 20^3

These 'decay.T*' files have been pruned from the raw output to remove duplicate entries.
