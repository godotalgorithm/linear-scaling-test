This directory contains all the inputs used to generate the data and figures in the paper,
except the cluster geometries (which can be procedurally generated in the "structures" directory)
and the VASP "POTCAR" projector-augmented-wave file (which is proprietary).

All timing benchmarks were run on one node of the "Uno" cluster at Sandia National Laboratories,
which consists of two Intel Sandy Bridge 2.7 GHz processors (E5-2680) and 64 GB of DDR3 RAM on a Lustre file system.
